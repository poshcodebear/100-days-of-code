# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a basic TicTacToe game

**Thoughts:** Getting everything working in Visual Studio from a project started on GitHub was a lot more complicated than expected; spending
time working on that robbed a fair amount of time from today's work, but I did at least get it started.

### Day 1: January 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made decent progress, all major components there, and grid drawing is made

**Thoughts:** I should never forget to set up my .gitignore file when working with Visual Studio.  I should probably look up common gitignore patterns for it.

That inital part of the coding session when I'm just staring at the screen trying to figure out what I'm going to do kind of sucks, but it feels good to push
past it.

Also, I should be spending at least some time on Twitter for this...I guess I'm failing on that part.

### Day 2: February 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Grid now redraws each turn and game can prompt for player input

**Thoughts:** "The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago.  The second best time is right now."

Fighing with console redraw is either frustrating or fun.  I'm really not sure which.  I'm confident the code I'm writing is ugly as sin, but it's kind of working for now.
I'll either redo the ugly parts and make it more elegant before I'm done or leave it as a testament to my fledgeling skills forever.  Probably the second,
but I will have at least one or two more days of working on this to figure it out.

Who knows?  Maybe I'll wind up spending the entire 100 days refining this...

Oh boy. (Been watching too much Quantum Leap lately...)

### Day 3: February 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Turn selection now uses arrow keys instead of prompting for numbers

**Thoughts:** That was either easier or harder than I expected.  I wish I knew which one it was.

Anyway, watching the various stages of it partially working as I was working on it was both frustrating (while things weren't working as expected)
and satisfying (as I got things to work).

Also, this wasn't exactly the part that I'd planned to work on; I'd actually planned on cleaning up some of the ugly parts to make them a bit more
streamlined and get them to flow a bit better.  However, I had an idea on how to do this and wanted to see if it would work as expected, and
naturally that meant the entire session got eaten with this.  That being said, doing this wound up unexpectedly giving me what I was after in the first place anyway.

Looks like the unexpected theme of today is "the unexpected".  I guess I really should have expected that...

### Day 4: February 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added winning conditions and a main menu

**Thoughts:** Not a lot to say about this one.  Can't really have a game without a way to win.

This feels like it's almost done.  I need to do some cleaning up to make it loop back to the main menu, but other than that, the only things I can think
to do with it are add a computer player (probably with a random selector, but maybe with a very rudamentary AI if I feel up to trying that) and 
some tweaks to make option selection look and feel nicer.
