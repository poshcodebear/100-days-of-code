# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a basic TicTacToe game

**Thoughts:** Getting everything working in Visual Studio from a project started on GitHub was a lot more complicated than expected; spending time working on that robbed a fair amount of time from today's work, but I did at least get it started.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
