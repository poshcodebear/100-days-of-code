# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a basic TicTacToe game

**Thoughts:** Getting everything working in Visual Studio from a project started on GitHub was a lot more complicated than expected; spending 
time working on that robbed a fair amount of time from today's work, but I did at least get it started.

### Day 1: January 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made decent progress, all major components there, and grid drawing is made

**Thoughts:** I should never forget to set up my .gitignore file when working with Visual Studio.  I should probably look up common gitignore patterns for it.

That inital part of the coding session when I'm just staring at the screen trying to figure out what I'm going to do kind of sucks, but it feels good to push 
past it.

Also, I should be spending at least some time on Twitter for this...I guess I'm failing on that part.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
