# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Project: TicTacToe

### Day 0: January 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on a basic TicTacToe game

**Thoughts:** Getting everything working in Visual Studio from a project started on GitHub was a lot more complicated than expected; spending
time working on that robbed a fair amount of time from today's work, but I did at least get it started.

### Day 1: January 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made decent progress, all major components there, and grid drawing is made

**Thoughts:** I should never forget to set up my .gitignore file when working with Visual Studio.  I should probably look up common gitignore patterns for it.

That inital part of the coding session when I'm just staring at the screen trying to figure out what I'm going to do kind of sucks, but it feels good to push
past it.

Also, I should be spending at least some time on Twitter for this...I guess I'm failing on that part.

### Day 2: February 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Grid now redraws each turn and game can prompt for player input

**Thoughts:** "The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago.  The second best time is right now."

Fighing with console redraw is either frustrating or fun.  I'm really not sure which.  I'm confident the code I'm writing is ugly as sin, but it's kind of working for now.
I'll either redo the ugly parts and make it more elegant before I'm done or leave it as a testament to my fledgeling skills forever.  Probably the second,
but I will have at least one or two more days of working on this to figure it out.

Who knows?  Maybe I'll wind up spending the entire 100 days refining this...

Oh boy. (Been watching too much Quantum Leap lately...)

### Day 3: February 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Turn selection now uses arrow keys instead of prompting for numbers

**Thoughts:** That was either easier or harder than I expected.  I wish I knew which one it was.

Anyway, watching the various stages of it partially working as I was working on it was both frustrating (while things weren't working as expected)
and satisfying (as I got things to work).

Also, this wasn't exactly the part that I'd planned to work on; I'd actually planned on cleaning up some of the ugly parts to make them a bit more
streamlined and get them to flow a bit better.  However, I had an idea on how to do this and wanted to see if it would work as expected, and
naturally that meant the entire session got eaten with this.  That being said, doing this wound up unexpectedly giving me what I was after in the first place anyway.

Looks like the unexpected theme of today is "the unexpected".  I guess I really should have expected that...

### Day 4: February 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added winning conditions and a main menu

**Thoughts:** Not a lot to say about this one.  Can't really have a game without a way to win.

This feels like it's almost done.  I need to do some cleaning up to make it loop back to the main menu, but other than that, the only things I can think
to do with it are add a computer player (probably with a random selector, but maybe with a very rudamentary AI if I feel up to trying that) and
some tweaks to make option selection look and feel nicer.

### Day 5: February 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added main loop and selection highlighting

**Thoughts:** Other than any cleanup I feel like doing in the future or adding features like an AI opponent, this project is done.  I'm ready to
move on to my next one.

I'm feeling pretty good, even if I do feel like my game could still use a lot of improvements.

## Project: JusTipe

### Day 6: February 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started new project: JusTipe

**Thoughts:** It always feels good to start something new, something exciting.

Switching gears, moving into the world of WPF, and didn't even get to write hardly any actual C# code this time around.  Mostly spent the session
drawing in the layout window and manipulating the XAML to get it to come out more or less the way I want.

I'm not really sure if I should be focusing on the logic first or the GUI form first, but I decided to go with the GUI since I'm not really sure how
to approach the challenge if I don't have anywhere for interaction to actually happen.  Maybe this is something I should be working on as well.

### Day 7: February 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JusTipe now functionally complete

**Thoughts:** It also always feels good to get something you're working on pretty much done in one sitting.

I'm hoping this doesn't wind up as an 80/20, where the last 20% of the project will take the other 80% of my time, but I do have some cleanup that
I'll need to do before I will consider it "done".  Mostly, though, I think it's going to be minor tweaks (the text field should be adjusted to allow
enter to work, and I need to make sure it will scroll), comments, and cleanup, though I might also take the time to add an actual user guide.

I mean, these things are important, too.

And I need to be thinking about what my next project is going to be.  I expected this one to not take long, but I didn't think it would be *this* fast!

### Day 8: February 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Minor tweaks and improvements

**Thoughts:** I didn't really take the full hour (more like 20 minutes), but I did still make progress.  The textbox now allows multiline entry, and
the save button has some improvements as well.

Even if it's just a little thing to say that I did do some code today, I'm glad I took the time to do it anyway.

### Day 9: February 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up code and added comments

**Thoughts:** I'm just going to call this done at this point.

Got started late again, but was able to get it to where I'm willing to call it "done".  I'll probably loop back around and add some documentation,
or at least update the readme, but for now, this is good.

## Project: RSSSharp

### Day 10: February 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started new project

**Thoughts:** As usual, naming and getting everything set up seems to take longer than you'd think it would.

Decided what some of the basic classes should be; I'm going to be doing this in a bit more OOP manner than my last two.  Though, still not exactly
fully using OOP techniques.

I do need to move the laptop I work on back into my office...too distracting where it is, and only having one monitor slows me down.
